Guppy Basecaller is a software tool to convert the raw electrical signal data from nanopore sequencing into DNA sequences. 
Here's an example of a commonly used command with Guppy Basecaller:

guppy_basecaller -i /input/directory -s /output/directory --config configuration.cfg

In this command:

- -i /input/directory specifies the input directory where the raw data files (.fast5 files) are located.
- -s /output/directory specifies the output directory where the basecalled reads will be written.
- --config configuration.cfg is used to specify a configuration file that contains the basecalling model and other settings.

This command will basecall the raw data in the specified input directory using the settings from the configuration file, and write the output to the specified output directory.
