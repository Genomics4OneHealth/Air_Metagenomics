# Taxonomic Classification Tools for Metagenomic Data

Taxonomic classification is a crucial step in metagenomic analysis, allowing researchers to identify and quantify the microbial composition of environmental samples. This chapter outlines several tools commonly used for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, including those derived from nanopore sequencing.
