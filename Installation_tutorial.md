## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) and Conda installed on your system to manage packages and environments. If not, install Miniconda or Anaconda from their respective websites.

### Guppy and Dorado
1. **Guppy**: Download and install Guppy from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies website. Follow the installation instructions provided there.
2. **Dorado**: Similarly, download Dorado from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies website and follow their installation guide.

### Other Tools via Mamba or Pip
After setting up Guppy and Dorado, install the remaining tools required for the project. We recommend using Mamba for faster installation of Conda packages, or pip for Python packages not available on Conda.

#### Using Mamba
First, install Mamba in your base Conda environment:
```bash
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Then, create a new environment and install required packages:
```bash
mamba create -n airseq-env python=3.8
conda activate airseq-env
mamba install -c bioconda <package_name>
```

Replace `<package_name>` with the names of the bioinformatics tools you need.

#### Using Pip
For tools or libraries available on PyPI, use pip within the Conda environment:
```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Again, replace `<package_name>` with the actual package names.

### Verification
After installation, verify that each tool is correctly installed and accessible:
```bash
guppy_basecaller --version
dorado --version
<other_tool> --version
```

Replace `<other_tool>` with the command to check the version of the other installed tools.

This setup ensures all necessary software for the project is installed and ready for use.

This section of the README provides users with a clear guide to setting up their environment for your project, including the installation of key tools like Guppy and Dorado, as well as other dependencies through Mamba or pip.
