| Output | - List of detected virulence genes<br>- Associated virulence mechanisms |

## ShortBRED

ShortBRED (Short, Better Representative Extract Dataset) can be used for quantifying AMR genes and virulence factors in metagenomic data.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| How it Works | Uses unique marker peptides to identify and quantify protein families |
| Input | Metagenomic sequencing reads |
| Output | - Abundance profiles of AMR genes and virulence factors<br>- Quantitative measurements of gene presence |

## Considerations for Nanopore Data

When working with nanopore sequencing data for AMR and virulence detection:

1. Long read advantage: Nanopore's long reads can improve the detection of complete AMR genes and operons.
2. Higher error rates: Tools may need to be adjusted to account for the higher error rates in nanopore data.
3. Real-time analysis: Some tools can be adapted for real-time analysis of nanopore data streams.
4. Hybrid approaches: Combining nanopore data with short reads can enhance accuracy in AMR and virulence detection.
