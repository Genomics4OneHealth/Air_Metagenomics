# Air Monitoring by Nanopore Sequencing

## Detailed Overview

This project utilizes metagenomic analysis of bioaerosols to monitor air quality, employing the latest advancements in nanopore sequencing technology. Our workflow is designed to extract, process, and analyze genetic material from air samples to understand microbial compositions. Key stages include:

- [Processing of Reads](#processing-of-reads)
- [Base Calling with Guppy and Dorado](#base-calling-with-guppy-and-dorado)
- [Assembly of Metagenomes](#assembly-of-metagenomes)
- [Binning](#binning)
- [Quality Control](#quality-control)
- [Taxonomic Classification](#taxonomic-classification)
- [Protein Classification and Functional Annotation](#protein-classification-and-functional-annotation)

By integrating high-frequency nanopore sequencing with detailed bioinformatic analysis, this project aims to enhance our understanding of air microbial compositions.

## Processing of Reads
Initial processing involves quality control and preparation of raw sequencing reads, including error correction and adapter trimming, to ensure data accuracy.

## Base Calling with Guppy and Dorado
Base calling translates the electrical signals from nanopore sequencing into nucleotide sequences using Guppy and Dorado. This critical step converts raw data at a sequencing frequency of 4 or 5 kilohertz, enabling precise identification of nucleotides from the electrical signal generated by the DNA passing through nanopores.

## Assembly of Metagenomes
We assemble metagenomes from high-quality reads, reconstructing the genomic sequences of organisms present in bioaerosol samples. This process creates comprehensive genomic profiles for in-depth analysis.

## Binning
Sequences are sorted into bins based on genomic content, separating different organisms' genomes for targeted analysis.

## Quality Control
Quality control is integral at all stages, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data from sequencing to assembly and binning.

## Taxonomic Classification
Our analysis includes taxonomic classification at the read, contig, and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) levels, providing insights into the diversity and structure of microbial communities.

## Protein Classification and Functional Annotation
We classify proteins and annotate genes and genomes to understand the biological functions and potential environmental impacts of identified organisms.

### Guppy Basecaller
This software tool, provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), is used to convert the raw electrical signal data from nanopore sequencing into DNA sequences, a process known as basecalling.

### Porechop
This tool is developed for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. It finds and removes adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads.

### NanoFilt
This is a simple tool to filter Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. It reads in a FASTQ file (or stdin), filters reads based on a minimum quality and/or a minimum length, and writes out the filtered reads to stdout.

### Flye
This is a de novo assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It can be run in 'meta' mode for metagenomic projects.

### Minimap2
This tool serves as an aligner for bio-sequences. In the context of nanopore sequencing, it aligns the raw nanopore reads to the assembled sequences produced by Flye. The `-ax map-ont` option specifies that the input data is Oxford Nanopore reads. The output is a BAM file sorted by samtools.

### Racon
It is a tool that performs consensus sequencing. It takes as input the raw nanopore reads, the alignment file produced by Minimap2, and the assembly produced by Flye, and then it generates a consensus sequence that represents an 'improved' version of the initial assembly. This step is also known as 'polishing' the assembly.

### MetaWRAP
MetaWRAP is a comprehensive pipeline designed for the efficient analysis of metagenomic data. It integrates several bioinformatics tools and workflows to streamline the process of quality control, assembly, binning,
