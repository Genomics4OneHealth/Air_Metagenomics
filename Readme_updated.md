# Air Monitoring by Nanopore Sequencing

## Detailed Overview

This project utilizes metagenomic analysis of bioaerosols to monitor air quality, employing the latest advancements in nanopore sequencing technology. Our workflow is designed to extract, process, and analyze genetic material from air samples to understand microbial compositions. Key stages include:

### Processing of Reads
Initial processing involves quality control and preparation of raw sequencing reads, including error correction and adapter trimming, to ensure data accuracy.

### Base Calling with Guppy and Dorado
Base calling translates the electrical signals from nanopore sequencing into nucleotide sequences using Guppy and Dorado. This critical step converts raw data at a sequencing frequency of 5 kilohertz, enabling precise identification of nucleotides from the electrical signal generated by the DNA passing through nanopores.

### Assembly of Metagenomes
We assemble metagenomes from high-quality reads, reconstructing the genomic sequences of organisms present in bioaerosol samples. This process creates comprehensive genomic profiles for in-depth analysis.

### Binning
Sequences are sorted into bins based on genomic content, separating different organisms' genomes for targeted analysis.

### Quality Control
Quality control is integral at all stages, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data from sequencing to assembly and bining.

### Taxonomic Classification
Our analysis includes taxonomic classification at the read, contig, and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) levels, providing insights into the diversity and structure of microbial communities.

### Protein Classification and Functional Annotation
We classify proteins and annotate genes and genomes to understand the biological functions and potential environmental impacts of identified organisms.

By integrating high-frequency nanopore sequencing with detailed bioinformatic analysis, this project aims to enhance our understanding of air microbial compositions.
